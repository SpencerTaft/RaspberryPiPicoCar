:::::Processing:::::
- Dual-core cortex M0+ at up to 133MH
- 264kB multi-bank high performance SRAM
- High performance full-crossbar bus fabric (allows cpus, gpus, memory to communicate easily)


:::::Memory:::::
- 2MB flash memory


:::::Connection:::::
- WIFI 802.11n, single band 2.4GHz (600Mbps)
- WPA3 (connection security)
- Soft access point, four clients (wireless access point, software based)
- Bluetooth 5.2
    > Support for Bluetooth LE Central and Peripheral roles (peripheral devices provides services/data to a primary bluetooth device)
    > Support for Bluetooth Classic


:::::Electric Input/Output:::::
- 26 multi-function 3.3V GPIO
    > 23 digital only
    > 3 ADC (12-bit 500ksps analogue to digital converter (input)
    > 1.8-3.3V I/O voltage
- 2 UART (communication, async, single wire protocol)
- 2 I2C (communication, sync, dual wire protocol (data plus clock))
- 2 SPI (communication, master-slave, 4 wire: master in slave out, master out slave in, clock, chip select (which slave device to communicate with))
- 16 PWM channels (how DAC is achieved)
- 2 programmable I/O (PIO) blocks, 8 state machines in total (logic that can run independently of CPU)
    > Flexible, user-programmable high-speed I/O
    > Can emulate interfaces such as SD card and VGA
    > (2 fifo queues, one for data in and one for data out)
        > can be used to implement custom communication protocols, control LED's etc.
        > can handle precise timing

:::::Power:::::
- power over micro usb



:::::Hardware:::::
- 40-pin 21mm√ó51mm 'DIP' style 1mm thick PCB with 0.1" through-hole pins also with edge castellations


:::::Software:::::
- multicore support, can run two cores at once maximum
